Welcome to the Python Turtle Snake Game

Click on the console to be able to use the arrow keys to move the snake!

If your snake touches the screen boundaries or itself, then you lose!

Also, a little fun twist, if you don't eat the food within a certain time frame, the snake will start shrinking!

Have fun!
